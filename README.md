# ChatApp Automation Testing Project

This project is used for testing ChatApp from @hongducdev and his team.
I used Python with Selenium as base for website testing. Since the test was deployed on Amazon EC2 machine, there was
also a bash script to update the remote server and trigger the test through SSH. To make the result easier to
understand, I combined it with a BBD framework on Python called Behave. Finally, the overall result was displayed on
terminal and the detailed one can be accessed through HTTP in XML format.
